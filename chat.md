Cubic Z: Hello there Yoda. Let's use this MD file for putting messages in here, when one of us us offline, as Repl deletes the chat history when both of us leave the site. Respond back if you see this.  We will also be using this to update our progress in programming the bot. See you. 

Gotcha -yoda

so im adding a checker that looks for pings,(slowy)
but wait 1 sec

**Update (Cubic Z)**: Added better permissions and guildOnly Commands

Hey yoda, I moved your ping checker to /events/message.js - Cubic

loading the bot should take about 5 seconds now because of mathjs. So when you start it up, wait 5 seconds until a log in the console comes in. -Cubic

I am currently working on the help commmand for specific commands to make it into an embed. -Cubic

aight -yoda

LATEST UPDATE: I have FINALLY created user variables! ./commands/under development/user-variables.js -Cubic

also for this new bot, hook me up with sum more details aight? -yoda

Ok, about this new bot, it'll basically be a utility bot. For example it will have a heist command like noumenon's but this time in js. It will have utility commands, and a partnership request command. Speaking of partnership requests, I am currently in the process of programming one. -Cubic
